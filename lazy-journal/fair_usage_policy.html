    <h1>Fair Usage Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-31</p>
    <p>This Fair Usage Policy ("Policy") governs your use of the Lazy Journal mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to this Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful, personal journaling purposes. You will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App to violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
      <li>Attempt to bypass rate limits, security controls, or access restrictions.</li>
      <li>Use automated scripts, bots, or abusive traffic that could degrade service.</li>
      <li>Upload content that is illegal, harmful, or infringes intellectual property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Usage Limits</h2>
    <p>We may apply rate limits or quota limits to protect the service and prevent abuse. These limits may change over time.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibility and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of the country where you are a citizen, resident, or physically located, including any rules governing content you create, store, or transmit.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Data and Device Responsibility</h2>
    <p>The App stores journal data locally on your device. You are responsible for the security of your device and any local backups. If your device is lost, compromised, or shared, your data may be exposed.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses third-party services to process audio and generate summaries. Your data is transmitted to these services as part of the App’s functionality. See the Privacy Policy for details.</p>

    <h2>6. Enforcement</h2>
    <p>We may restrict or terminate access to the App if we detect abuse or violations of this Policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
