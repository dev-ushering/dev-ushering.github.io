    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-31</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Lazy Journal ("App") handles your data. By using the App, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Handle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio recordings you create in the App</li>
      <li>Transcriptions, summaries, mood scores, and tags generated from recordings</li>
      <li>Device identifiers needed for authentication and recovery</li>
      <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>We use your data solely to provide the App’s features, including transcription, summarization, and journaling functionality. We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to the App’s features.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Processing</h2>
    <p>The App sends data to third-party services (e.g., AI transcription and analysis providers) in order to deliver core functionality. These services may process your data on their servers. While we take reasonable measures to reduce data exposure, transmission and processing by third parties inherently carry risk.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage and User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Journal entries and derived data are stored locally on your device. You are responsible for securing your device, backups, and any local files. The app author is not responsible for exposure caused by device loss, unauthorized access, or insecure backups.</p>

    <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We use encryption and secure storage where possible, and we continuously improve the App’s security. However, no system is perfectly secure. We do not guarantee that unauthorized access or disclosure will never occur.</p>

    <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The app author is not responsible for the disclosure of private data to third parties, including disclosure resulting from third-party service providers, misconfigurations, device compromise, or user actions. We make reasonable efforts to prevent data leakage and misuse.</p>

    <h2>7. Legal Compliance and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the App complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your country of citizenship, residence, or current location. This includes any restrictions on the content you record, store, or transmit.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
